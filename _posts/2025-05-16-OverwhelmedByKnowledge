Again, seemingly at a loss for words. I'm a bright individual (and generally a quick learner)
with the itch to learn more about our technological world. I have a few friends that're 
programmers in my corner, in case I run into any tough coding problems. There's so much to learn!
It's almost daunting, but I feel motivated moreso than intimidated by the challenges ahead.
